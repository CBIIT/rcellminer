Description: The NCI-60 cancer cell line panel has been used over the course of
  several decades as an anti-cancer drug screen. This panel was developed as
  part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/)
  of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Thousands of compounds have been
  tested on the NCI-60, which have been extensively characterized by many
  platforms for gene and protein expression, copy number, mutation, and others
  (Reinhold, et al., 2012). The purpose of the CellMiner project
  (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer) has been to integrate data
  from multiple platforms used to analyze the NCI-60 and to provide a powerful
  suite of tools for exploration of NCI-60 data.
